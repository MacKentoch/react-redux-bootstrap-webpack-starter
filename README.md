> My best React + redux project starter.

- *webpack is as simple as possible*
- *ReactJS is written with `optimization tricks` (stateless, pure render...).*
- *`pure front-end` = server independant (use whatever you want as server: NodeJS, Rails, .NET...)*

*Concept behind:* same as [react-bootstrap-webpack-starter](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter) **but added `Redux` and amazing and helpful `redux-devtools`.**

## Breaking changes since v3.0.0
- upgrade to `react-router v4`


## Breaking changes since v2.3.0
- upgrade to `webpack 2.x`
- upgrade `React 15.5.x +`
 - `PropTypes` from 'prop-types' (*react 15.5 breaking change*)


## Breaking changes since v2.2.0
- `cross-env` added so no more particular windows command
- serve dev and prod bundles 
 - `npm run serve-dev`: with server hot reload (*uses nodemon*)
 - `npm run serve-prod`: production like node-express server


## Breaking changes since v2.1.0
- `whatwg-fetch` is now replaced by [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios).
- `react-addons-shallow-compare` is removed since ReactJS 15.4+ PureComponent does the job
- splits vendors script and css from main bundle (*extract-text-webpack-plugin v1.x*)
- create map file (DEV)
- prepared `launch.json` for VSCode debugger
- add typescript types (typings)
- add flow types (flow-typed)

## Breaking changes since v2.0.0
- redux-devtools is now replaced by [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#redux-devtools-extension).
