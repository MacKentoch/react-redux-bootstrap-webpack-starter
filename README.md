> My best React + redux project starter.

- _webpack is as simple as possible_
- _ReactJS is written with `optimization tricks` (stateless, hooks, pure render, PureComponent...)._
- _`pure front-end` = server independant (use whatever you want as server: NodeJS, Rails, .NET...)_
- `SPA` but `SEO` and/or `PWA` friendly since use of `dynamic imports` and `application snapshot`.

_Concept behind:_ same as [react-bootstrap-webpack-starter](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter) **but added `Redux` and amazing and helpful [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#redux-devtools-extension).**
