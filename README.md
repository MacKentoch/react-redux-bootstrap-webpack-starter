> My best React + redux project starter.

- *webpack is as simple as possible*
- *ReactJS is written with `optimization tricks` (stateless, pure render, PureComponent...).*
- *`pure front-end` = server independant (use whatever you want as server: NodeJS, Rails, .NET...)*
- `SPA` but `SEO` and/or `PWA` friendly since use of `dynamic imports` and `application snapshot`.

*Concept behind:* same as [react-bootstrap-webpack-starter](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter) **but added `Redux` and amazing and helpful [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#redux-devtools-extension).**
